# Team 1: HWATG ("Hard Work and the Grind") / Dual-Meets

Developers of DavisBot.

```Mapping/``` and ```OpenCVCode``` contain experimental code for using text file maps, detecting blocks, etc. The ```TamProxy*/``` folders contain required code for interfacing with the Teensy microcontroller on our robot. All of the ROS code that ran on our robot lives in ```catkin_ws/``` workspace.
